# update-bios
update-bios is a python script that uses the youtube api to access my latest yotube video link and update my Instagram and Twitter bios

I use python with the selenium library.

My credentials (youtube API_KEY, Twitter, and Instagram) are stored in a seperate file called 'credentials.py'
They are all variables of type string.
